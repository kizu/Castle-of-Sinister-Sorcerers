# Castle of Sinister-Sorcerers

This is a test project made for one contest named [Browser Wars](http://webstandardsdays.ru/browser-war/). (in russian) 

* You can see the latest version here â€” http://kizu.github.com/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers/
* Or download [the version as it was to the contest's deadline](https://github.com/downloads/kizu/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers_v2011-10-24.zip)

I hadn't enought time to finish it, so there are a lot of bugs and unfinished parts here and there, expecially in Opera. So, looks best in webkits and firefox.

The highlights of code:

* Only CSS used, no JavaScript (except for yandex' counter).
* Only CSS-transitions used, no CSS-animations. One of the goals I set to myself were to limit the uses of the animations and create them only by combining the transitions. A lot of bugs appeared in all browsers, I had a lot of things to learn from this.
