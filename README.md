# Castle of Sinister-Sorcerers

This is a test project made for one contest named [Browser Wars](http://webstandardsdays.ru/browser-war/). (in russian) 

* You can see the latest version here â€” http://kizu.github.com/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers/
* Or download [the version as it was to the contest's deadline](https://github.com/downloads/kizu/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers/Castle-of-Sinister-Sorcerers_v2011-10-24.zip)

I hadn't enought time to finish it, so there are a lot of bugs and unfinished parts here and there, expecially in Opera. So, looks best in webkits and firefox.
